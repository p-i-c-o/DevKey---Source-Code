      <h1>Files</h1>
      <p>We are back in the 'DevKey' folder, AKA the 'root' folder.</p>
      <h3>Commands you will learn</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>mkdir</strong>
          : Make a directory
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>touch</strong>
          : Create a file
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>nano</strong>
          : Edit a file
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>MKDIR</h3>
      <p>
        'mkdir' is a command that creates a folder where you currently are. We
        use it by typing 'mkdir' and the name you want to give the folder! Let's
        create a folder called 'Test Folder'
      </p>
      <code>mkdir Test Folder</code>
      <p>
        Everything seems in order when we run this, but we accidentally made 2
        seperate folders. We made a folder called 'Test' and 'Folder'. Let's try
        again:
      </p>
      <code>mkdir 'Test Folder'</code>
      <p>
        Above is the proper method to make a folder with spaces in it's name.
        There is another method, but it isn't as easy:
      </p>
      <code>mkdir Test\ Folder/</code>
      <p>
        I don't reccoment the above method because it requires you to add a
        backslash every time, but the quotation
      </p>
      <h3>TOUCH</h3>
      <p>
        Even with its odd name, this command is one of the most usefull commands
        for quickly creating empty files. Let's say we want to create a file
        called 'message.txt', we would do it like this:
      </p>
      <code>touch message.txt</code>
      <p>That's it, really!</p>
      <p>
        A usefull flag that could prevent mistakes is '-c', it makes sure that
        when you are creating the file, it won't overwrite another file named
        exactly the same. Useful!
      </p>
